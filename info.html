            Have you ever wondered what is real?
            How do you know if you are only dreaming and how can you distinguish what is around you between reality,
            illusion or delusion? What is utopia and distopia? Do we live in a multi-dimensional universe? Or are we
            trapped in some kind of “Matrix”? Is that a trap or is it just normality? If it is normality we wouldn’t have to worry about a thing.
            Right? What does really define what we call reality?

        <div class="col-md-8">
            This is are all questions of many curious minds and that put on the table the reflection of identity, definition, reality or not. Most of them were the starting point of the research and lead to this final major project. The project involved a major research on many topics related to the reality inside of each individual and around him.<br><br>

            What does our mind think it’s real? Can you really give it a clear definition? Alan Watts puts it much more simpler.<br><br>

            Watts was a British speaker and writer, popularizer of Eastern wisdom. He wrote many books and articles on religion and philosophy. He became a “guiding voice” for many people, helping them with his holistic vision. The quote presented is indeed much more simple to see if you do not let you brain complicate it. <br><br>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            Luísa Ribeiro, graphic designer based in Lisbon, Portugal.<br><br>

            The human mind is a very interesting topic of mine. I would question myself how do we think as see stuff like we do, or at least, most of us. It intrigues me how distinct minds interpret the exact same things differently.<br><br>
            
            Another thing that triggered my interest in the mind was that I would often, and sometimes still do catch my self in brain fog. The mix of confused feelings and thoughts has always driven me nuts. Despite this being a huge problem in the process of most of my creative works, it has also been a part of the idea for this final major project.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">

            Since I was little that I would sudden stop whatever I was doing and had the strange feeling of being an outsider of my self, if that makes any sense. I would often think that I could be merely a part of a dream, just a character in some series or even some play, like “The Sims”.<br><br>

            Therefore, at the beginning of the process to wrap up the main idea for this project, I started wondering
            through the topics of different mentalities, diagnosed with diseases and the meaning of reality. I had some other ideas but this were the ones that most caught my attention.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            I ended up choosing the last one because I thought that it was more extensive and probably something I could
            be enlightened with. In fact, many questions emerged, further related to my own curiosities.<br>
            <br>
            The research is endless, I could never stop making more questions and go deeper. That is why I decided to
            simplify my own mind by taking this words from Alan Watts, who is some kind of “guiding voice” of mine as
            well.<br><br>

            Anyone who makes a quich research can see that he was not a perfect man, neither his arguments were or are
            absolute. However he takes a peculiar view that can turn a mind full of fog a little bit more clear.
